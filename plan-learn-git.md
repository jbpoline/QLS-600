# A practical and fundamental introduction to Git 
## JB Poline, QLS-C-600

## Who is this lesson for:

You have heard of git, but you really are not using it daily. You would like to understand its concepts, and get some practice. You want to use it for collaborative and/or open science work. If you are proficient in git, e.g., you have multiple repos and you are interacting with other developers through GitHub, gitlab, bitbucket or other, you do not need to follow this lesson.

## First, install the right software on your laptop. Do not think this is a trivial part - things can go wrong.
### Use these instructions :
From [the neurohackademy instructions](https://neurohackademy.org/setup/)
install
    1. bash
    2. git
    3. text editor
    4. python (recommended if you want to access some notebooks)

### what if I already have some of that ? 
Make sure that your version of git (>2.X) and python (>3.6) are recent

## Second, go through this introduction to Git by G. Sanchez

[A good motivation and intro to git](http://www.gastonsanchez.com/stat259/lectures/05-git-basics/)

[Slides are here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qJ4LhB2WQzDqVdWLvFF69wsQRbbPJeY2PxldZPn9PAU/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.g73bac4e51_0_118)

## Third, make sure you have a _conceptual_ grasp 

There are several good resources, here is one.
Read [this reference](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/git/git_basic_concepts.htm), it is short and will tell you the essentials.

You have already learnt some of it from the Sanchez' lecture. See below a list of the most important aspects. After, reading, you should have a conceptual notion of :
- What is a commit (what does a commit capture?)
- What is a git repository (what is it made of?)
- What is a reference
- What is the "working tree"
- What is the "staging area"
- What are branches / tags
- What are remotes

## Fourth, get some practice 

The next step is to practice using git.   

[Go and follow this practical tutorial](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/index.html)
[At your leisure, get more experience by playing with git](https://try.github.io/)

You will probably go back to section 3 (concepts) 

## Fifth, Collaborate !

For Thursday April 9th, you will need to have:
- A GitHub account (sign in)
- Git and bash on your machine.

We will spend an hour collaborating with git on GitHub this Thursday.
